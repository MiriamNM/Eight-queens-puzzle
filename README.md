## Welcome to Eight-queens-puzzle!

[The eight queens puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The eight queens puzzle is an example of the more general n queens problem of placing n non-attacking queens on an nÃ—n chessboard, for which solutions exist for all natural numbers n with the exception of n = 2 and n = 3.[1]
